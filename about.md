Hello.

I'm Radosław Kujawa, an open source enthusiast and self-proclaimed hacker. 

At [dayjob](http://osec.pl/) I teach Linux. At night I code things [no one ever heard about](http://github.com/rkujawa) and create [hardware for retro computers](http://sakura-it.pl). I'm also a volunteer [developer](http://wiki.netbsd.org/users/rkujawa) at the NetBSD Foundation. In the meantime I also try to be a husband and father.

I'll be sharing stuff I consider interesting on this blog.

Thanks for reading!

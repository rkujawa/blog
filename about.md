Hello.

I'm Rados≈Çaw Kujawa, an open source enthusiast and self-proclaimed hacker. 

At dayjob I teach Linux. At night I code things [no one ever heard about](http://github.com/rkujawa) and create [hardware for retro computers](http://sakura-it.pl). I'm also a volunteer [developer](http://wiki.netbsd.org/users/rkujawa) at the NetBSD Foundation. In the meantime I try to be a husband and a father.

I'll be sharing stuff I consider interesting on this blog.

You can contact me via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/RadoslawKujawa).

Thanks for reading!
